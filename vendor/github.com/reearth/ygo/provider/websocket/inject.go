// Apply auto-creates the room if needed, runs fn with a bound transact
// helper, captures the update(s) produced by fn's transaction(s), and
// fans the result out to all connected peers.
//
// fn MUST call transact() to mutate the doc. Calls to doc.GetText,
// doc.GetMap, doc.GetXmlFragment, etc. must happen OUTSIDE transact():
// these acquire the doc's write lock, which transact() already holds,
// so calling them inside would deadlock.
//
// fn should be fast — it runs inside the doc's write lock and blocks
// all peer reads and writes to the room for the duration.
//
// fn must not spawn goroutines that call transact after fn returns.
// Any such late transact invocation will commit to the doc (the
// origin is still recognized by the private OnUpdate listener until
// the deferred unsub fires) but its delta will not be captured or
// broadcast — Apply's captured-snapshot happens immediately after
// fn returns. The doc state will drift from live peers in the same
// way an unapplied BroadcastUpdate does.
//
// ctx is checked once at entry and not re-checked after fn returns.
// Once fn's transaction commits, the update has already been queued
// to persistence via the existing OnUpdate hook. Aborting the
// broadcast on late context cancellation would leave live peers out
// of sync with persisted state — the same hazard warned about on
// BroadcastUpdate. Context cancellation during fn is therefore a
// best-effort signal; the transaction completes unless fn itself
// observes ctx and returns early.
//
// IMPORTANT: if fn calls doc.Transact directly (bypassing the supplied
// transact helper), the delta is NOT captured and Apply returns
// ErrNoChanges even though the doc has been mutated. This is a
// contract violation, but the behavior is well-defined.
//
// IMPORTANT: ErrUpdateTooLarge is post-hoc. The size check runs after
// the transaction commits and after persistence has enqueued the
// update. On this error the server's doc reflects fn's mutation and
// the update IS persisted, but peers do NOT see it. This creates the
// same divergence hazard as a BroadcastUpdate without ApplyUpdateV1.
// Callers who set MaxUpdateBytes should size-bound fn's effects
// explicitly or prepare to reconcile via a sync step 1/2 exchange.
//
// NOTE: a panic inside fn propagates to the caller. The OnUpdate
// subscription is cleaned up via defer, so no listener leaks. Starting
// in v1.1.1, Doc.Transact is panic-safe: the doc lock is released and
// observers fire with whatever partial state fn committed before the
// panic. Apply therefore broadcasts that partial state to peers and
// triggers persistence before re-raising the panic. Callers should
// still avoid panicking fn bodies in production because the doc is
// left with unrolled-back partial mutations; recover and either
// reconcile via sync or recreate the doc from persistence.
