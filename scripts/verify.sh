# scripts/verify.sh — verify a downloaded wede release artifact, fail-closed.
#
# This file is a COPY, not a shared dependency: it has no imports, no sourced
# helpers and no sibling scripts. `curl` and one of `sha256sum` / `shasum` are
# the whole runtime, so it keeps working when everything else in the repo is
# unavailable — which is the situation a user verifying a download is in.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR
# ──────────────
# A wede release publishes one bare binary per platform plus a `checksums.txt`
# manifest. This script fetches
# the manifest, looks up the EXACT entry for the artifact you asked for,
# downloads the artifact and compares digests. It is what a user runs before
# executing bytes they pulled off the internet.
#
# THE CONTRACT: FAIL CLOSED
# ─────────────────────────
# There are exactly two outcomes: "these bytes are the published bytes" (exit
# 0) or a non-zero exit with a diagnostic naming what was wrong. There is NO
# --skip-verify, NO "warn and continue", and — the one that matters most — NO
# path where an ABSENT or UNREADABLE manifest is treated as "nothing to check".
#
# That last case is the bug this file exists to not have. A verifier that
# shrugs at a 404 on checksums.txt prints a line that looks like verification
# happened while checking nothing at all, and is strictly worse than no
# verifier: it converts "I don't know" into "it's fine".
#
# FOUR DEFECTS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE
# ────────────────────────────────────────────
# These were all found in a sibling installer by adversarial audit. If you edit
# this file, re-read them, because each one is easy to reintroduce:
#
#  1. NO FALL-OPEN. Every fetch failure aborts. Nothing degrades to an
#     unverified path when the network, the CDN or the origin misbehaves.
#
#  2. NO SILENT DEATH AT A PIPELINE. Under `set -e` + `pipefail`, an assignment
#     like `x="$(grep ... | awk ... | head -1)"` KILLS THE SCRIPT with no
#     message when the grep matches nothing — so the carefully written "no
#     entry found" guard below it never runs. Every lookup pipeline here ends
#     in `|| true` and its result is then explicitly tested for emptiness. The
#     guard has to be reachable to be a guard.
#
#  3. NO `\n` IN A `%s`. Diagnostics are multi-line by design; `die` takes one
#     line per argument and prints each with its own `printf`. Nothing embeds
#     "\n" in a message, so no message can render as literal backslash-n, and
#     no filename or digest echoed back into a message is ever interpreted as
#     a printf format or a `%b` escape.
#
#  4. NO SUBSTRING / REGEX NAME MATCH. The artifact name is compared with awk
#     against FIELD 2 of the manifest, as a string. A substring grep treats the
#     name as a regex — every "." in a name like "wede-darwin-arm64" is a wildcard
#     — and would happily return the digest of "...tar.gz.sig", or of a
#     differently-punctuated asset. The selftest plants exactly those two traps.
#
# EXIT CODES — each failure mode has its own code AND its own diagnostic
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0   every requested artifact matched the published digest
#   2   usage error (no artifact named, no --tag/--base-url, unknown flag)
#   3   checksums.txt could not be fetched / does not exist (HTTP error, DNS,
#       refused connection, or absent from a local --dir)
#   4   checksums.txt was served, but the body is an HTML page, not a manifest
#       (captive portal, CDN error page, a 200 that means "no such key")
#   5   checksums.txt is empty, or contains no well-formed "<64 hex>  <name>" line
#   6   checksums.txt is valid but has no entry for the artifact requested
#   7   the artifact itself could not be fetched (HTTP error, or an HTML page
#       served where artifact bytes were expected)
#   8   the artifact download was truncated — the origin closed the connection
#       before delivering the Content-Length it declared
#   9   digest mismatch: the bytes are not the published bytes
#  10   a required local tool (curl, sha256sum/shasum) is missing
#  11   --attest was requested and the provenance attestation did not verify
#  12   refusing a plaintext http:// origin (non-loopback)
#
# On any non-zero exit the partial download is deleted, so a failed run can
# never leave a file that a later step mistakes for a verified one.

# The digest check needs only curl + sha256sum. `--attest` additionally
